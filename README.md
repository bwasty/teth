# teth - Toy Ethereum Client ![Actions Status](https://wdp9fww0r9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/production/badge/bwasty/teth)

## Goals
* implement Ethereum straight from the [Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/)
* (over)simplify things for a short and understandable implementation
  - compatibility with real Ethereum: maybe later

## Current state
Reading the Yellow Paper and stubbing some structs...
